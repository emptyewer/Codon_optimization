Codon Optimization
==================

In general (commercially) codon optimization for expression of a gene in a non-native expression system is performed by substituting the most-frequently used codons for the corresponding amino-acids. However, recent studies suggest there is more information encoded in the usage of rare and frequent codons. This encoded information is lost during such "blind" optimization procedures. Here, I have developed a new methodology to optimize a given DNA sequence such that its codon usage pattern in the expression system/organism closely matches that of the source organism.
